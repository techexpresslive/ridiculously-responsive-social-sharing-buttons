Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons. The last social sharing buttons you will ever need. 

== Description ==

Love them or hate them social sharing buttons appear to be with us for a while. It seemed like we were constantly making custom buttons for every single project, so we decided to create a super flexible system that would work in any container.

RRSSB is built with SASS, so you can easily customize it by tweaking a few variables. SVGs allow for tiny file size and retina support. Add or remove icons as you see fit - the rest will fill in automagically in the container.

This plugin is adapted from the RRSSB Github project you can find [here](https://github.com/kni-labs/rrssb).

There is now an Admin Menu that allows you to customize the look of your buttons. You can place the buttons under each of your posts or place the buttons anywhere with the shortcode [rrssb]!
