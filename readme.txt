Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons. The last social sharing buttons you will ever need. 

== Description ==

Love them or hate them social sharing buttons appear to be with us for a while. It seemed like we were constantly making custom buttons for every single project, so we decided to create a super flexible system that would work in any container.

RRSSB is built with SASS, so you can easily customize it by tweaking a few variables. SVGs allow for tiny file size and retina support. Add or remove icons as you see fit — the rest will fill in automagically in the container.

I did not make the RRSSB github project. I just made it into a Wordpress Plugin. The original RRSSB project can be found here: https://github.com/kni-labs/rrssb

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. There is no admin settings for this. The plugin is very simple. If you need to change something then just go modify rrssb.php.
