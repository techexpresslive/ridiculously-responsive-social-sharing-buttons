Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons. The last social sharing buttons you will ever need. 

== Description ==

Love them or hate them social sharing buttons appear to be with us for a while. It seemed like we were constantly making custom buttons for every single project, so we decided to create a super flexible system that would work in any container.

RRSSB is built with SASS, so you can easily customize it by tweaking a few variables. SVGs allow for tiny file size and retina support. Add or remove icons as you see fit — the rest will fill in automagically in the container.
